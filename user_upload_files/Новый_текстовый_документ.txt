                If you have stumbled on this site by mistake or were referred to it, consider this: 

                There are positions available for mobile application developers with experience
                building Android and iPhone apps (C#, Java), ideally proficient in storyboarding,
                character design, XML, Object-oriented programming, etc.

                We are looking to hire web-oriented developers (PHP++ or better) as well, preferably familiar 
                with memcached, vldb (myisam-vs-innodb):debate, (sphinx||tokyo||beanstalkd||omq), 
                even hadoop. Formal education is a plus, but not a requirement. 
                Experience, on the other hand, is.
                
                This is ideal for innovative, driven individuals that want to work 
                for a growing company with an expansive internet application 
                development portfolio.
                
                And yes, *everyone* is given a chance. We care more about the person 
                than the resume/diploma. Passing the test is the only way to submit 
                your resume, and once you do that we will contact you and answer any 
                question you may have. Thanks and good luck.
